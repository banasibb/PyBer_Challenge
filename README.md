# PyBer_Challenge
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
The purpose of thie project is to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Specifically, the client was interested in the following metrics:
- The total rides for each city type
- The total drivers for each city type
- The total amount of fares for each city type
- The average fare per ride for each city type
- The average fare per driver for each city type
The data was divided into three categories based on geographic region. A total of 66 cities qualified as "Urban," another 36 cities qualified as "Suburban," and the remaining 18 cities were considered "Rural" in this analysis. There were a total of 2,375 rides in the ride_data.csv data set
### Resources
- Software Python 3.7.13, Matplotlib 3.5.2
- Data: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
### Total Rides by City Type
Across all regions, the total number of rides was 2,375, with the total rides for Urban cities as 1625, total rides for Suburban cities equal to 625 and total rides for Rural cities as 125. The breakdown as a percentage of total PyBer rides is in the pie chart below:<br />

### Total Drivers by City Type
The total number of drivers across all three regions included in the client's data sets were 68,709. The total drivers for Urban cities as 59,602, total drivers for Suburban cities is 8570, and total drivers for Rural cities as just 537.The percentage breakdown is pictured below:<br />

### Total Fares by City Type
Across all regions, the total dollar amount for fares was $63,538.64. The total fares for Urban cities is $39,854.38, total fares for Suburban cities is $19,356.33 and the total fares for Rural areas is $4,327.93. Please see the pie chart for the visual representation of each dollar amount a percentage of the total fare sales.<br />

### PyBer Summary DataFrame
The data in the bullets aboved were summarized into a single dataframe for the client. The excerpted code is below:
 ```
    city_type = pyber_data_df.set_index([""type""])
rides_by_type = pyber_data_df.groupby([""type""]).count()[""ride_id""]
drivers_by_type = pyber_data_df.groupby([""type""]).sum()[""driver_count""]
sum_fares_by_type = pyber_data_df.groupby([""type""]).sum()[""fare""]
average_fares_ride = sum_fares_by_type / rides_by_type
averages_fares_driver = sum_fares_by_type / drivers_by_type

pyber_summary_df = pd.DataFrame({
    ""Total Rides"": rides_by_type,
    ""Total Drivers"": drivers_by_type,
    ""Total Fares"": sum_fares_by_type, 
    ""Average Fare per Ride"": average_fares_ride,
    ""Average Fare per Driver"": averages_fares_driver
})
pyber_summary_df
  ```

### Total Fare by City Type
The final line chart was created using the object-oriented interface method, plot the resample DataFrame using the df.plot() function. The excerpt of code is as follows:
 ```
ax = january_to_april_month_df.plot(figsize=(15, 6))
# Add y-axis label
ax.set_ylabel(""Fare ($USD)"")
x_axis = ax.axes.get_xaxis()
x_label = x_axis.get_label()
x_label.set_visible(False)
ax.set_title(""Total Fare by City Type"")
lgnd = plt.legend(loc=""center"", title=""type"")
# Import the style from Matplotlib.
from matplotlib import style
# Use the graph style fivethirtyeight.
style.use('fivethirtyeight')
plt.show()
  ```

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
