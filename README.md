# PyBer_Challenge
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
The purpose of thie project is to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Specifically, the client was interested in the following metrics:
- The total rides for each city type
- The total drivers for each city type
- The total amount of fares for each city type
- The average fare per ride for each city type
- The average fare per driver for each city type

### Resources
- Software Python 3.7.13, Matplotlib 3.5.2
- Data: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
### Total Rides by City Type
- The total rides for Urban cities is 1625.
- The total rides for Suburban cities is 625.
- The total rides for Rural cities is 125.
### Total Drivers by City Type
- The total drivers for Urban cities is 59602.
- The total drivers for Suburban cities is 8570.
- The total drivers for Rural cities is 537.
### Total Fares by City Type
- The total fares for Urban cities is $39,854.38.
- The total fares for Suburban cities is $19,356.33.
- The total fares for Rural cities is $4,327.93.
### PyBer Summary DataFrame
The data in the bullets aboved were summarized into a single dataframe for the client. The excerpted code is below:
 ```
    city_type = pyber_data_df.set_index([""type""])
rides_by_type = pyber_data_df.groupby([""type""]).count()[""ride_id""]
drivers_by_type = pyber_data_df.groupby([""type""]).sum()[""driver_count""]
sum_fares_by_type = pyber_data_df.groupby([""type""]).sum()[""fare""]
average_fares_ride = sum_fares_by_type / rides_by_type
averages_fares_driver = sum_fares_by_type / drivers_by_type

pyber_summary_df = pd.DataFrame({
    ""Total Rides"": rides_by_type,
    ""Total Drivers"": drivers_by_type,
    ""Total Fares"": sum_fares_by_type, 
    ""Average Fare per Ride"": average_fares_ride,
    ""Average Fare per Driver"": averages_fares_driver
})
pyber_summary_df
  ```

### Total Fare by City Type
The final line chart was created using the object-oriented interface method, plot the resample DataFrame using the df.plot() function. The excerpt of code is as follows:
 ```
ax = january_to_april_month_df.plot(figsize=(15, 6))
# Add y-axis label
ax.set_ylabel(""Fare ($USD)"")
x_axis = ax.axes.get_xaxis()
x_label = x_axis.get_label()
x_label.set_visible(False)
ax.set_title(""Total Fare by City Type"")
lgnd = plt.legend(loc=""center"", title=""type"")
# Import the style from Matplotlib.
from matplotlib import style
# Use the graph style fivethirtyeight.
style.use('fivethirtyeight')
plt.show()
  ```

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
